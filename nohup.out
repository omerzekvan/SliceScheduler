Connecting to the PostgreSQL database...
connection to server at "172.17.0.2", port 5432 failed: No route to host
	Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?

Exception occured why deleting the function:  'DBConn' object has no attribute 'cursor'
'DBConn' object has no attribute 'cursor'
